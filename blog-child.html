     Keeping a house clean especially in India with all the dust, dirt, and humidity is not easier. Unlike the west we still have our cleaning help that come in to sweep and swab but domestic help is getting more and more difficult these days and most have time limits to clean your home before running to their next job. Well, the trials and tribulations of domestic help is one I will quickly side step!

    In Bangalore I stay in a beautiful house, but it also has huge amounts of glass. Unfortunately one of the biggest pros in the architecture is also a big negative when it comes to cleaning! In my attempt to clean my house I have run through every floor cleaner/glass cleaner that is there in the market. Trust me have tried and tested many a brand. Though I still use a few market brands, over the years I have realized a non-toxic, eco friendly pantry staple sometimes works way better and many a times a more cost effective solution.

    Here are 5 Pantry staples to clean your home. To get started all you need is a couple of spray bottles and you're all set.
